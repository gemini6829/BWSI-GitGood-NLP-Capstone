BWSI-GitGood-NLP-Capstone
ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
Welcome to the BWSI-GitGood-NLP-Capstone repository! This project is the culmination of our team's work during the third week of the BWSI (Beaver Works Summer Institute) course, focusing on practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision.

Our goal was to build a semantic image search system that allows users to find images using natural language descriptions. Given a query description, the system returns images that match the description from a database. This repository contains all the code, models, and resources developed as part of this exciting capstone project.

âœ¨ Features
Semantic Similarity Search: Implements a core search mechanism that calculates the cosine similarity between a user's text query embedding and a database of image embeddings. Images with higher similarity scores are considered more semantically relevant to the query.

Zero-shot Image Retrieval: Uses a trained neural network with one layer to perform "zero-shot" retrieval, meaning the system can find images for categories or descriptions it has not been explicitly trained on, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.

MyGrad: Lightweight library that adds auto-differentiation to NumPy

NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations.

Matplotlib: Data and result visualization.
